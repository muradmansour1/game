Russian Roulette

## Project Description 

My game is called Russian Roulette it's a game where a gun will be loaded with 1 bullet in a revolver and the cylinder would spin and youll have a 16% chance of dying. The game will be able to be played by 2 players and the person that dies first loses.

## Pseudo Code
```
1) Let's set up the game:
   totalChambers = 6
   currentChamber
   playerAlive = true

2) Now, we want to create a function to pick a random chamber:
   FUNCTION randomlySelectChamber(totalChambers):
       RETURN randomNumber(1, totalChambers)

3) Next, we'll create a function to take turns:
   FUNCTION takeTurn():
       // This function will include steps 4 and 5

4) In each turn, we spin the revolver to randomize the chamber:
   FUNCTION spinRevolver():
       currentChamber = randomlySelectChamber(totalChambers)

5) After spinning, we pull the trigger and check the result:
   FUNCTION pullTrigger():
       IF currentChamber is the loaded chamber:
           playerAlive = false
           OUTPUT "Bang! You are dead."
       ELSE:
           OUTPUT "Click! You survived. Spin the chamber again."

// Now, let's start the game
WHILE playerAlive:
    takeTurn()

// The game is over
OUTPUT "Game Over."

  
```
